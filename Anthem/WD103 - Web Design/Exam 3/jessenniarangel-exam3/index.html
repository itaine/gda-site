<p>The Need for Speed (NFS) series are racing games, all of which employ the same fundamental rules and have similar mechanics. In each game, the player controls a race car in a variety of races, the goal being to win the race. In the tournament/career mode, the player must win a series of races in order to unlock vehicles, tracks, etc. Before playing each race, the player chooses a vehicle to race in and has the option of choosing the transmission of the vehicle, which includes automatic and manual transmission. All games in the series have some form of multiplayer mode allowing players to race one another via split screen, LAN or the Internet.</p>

<p>
Although the games share the same name, the tone and focus of the games has varied significantly, in one form or another. For example, in some games the cars can suffer mechanical and visual damage, while in other games the cars cannot be damaged at all, some games have physics—that is, the way the software simulates a real car behavior—that are reminiscent of a real car, while other games have forgiving physics (e.g. going through some curves at the slowest speed).</p>

<p>High Stakes introduced several new types of gameplay: High Stakes, Getaway, Time Trap, and Career. High Stakes is a racing mode (within Career) in which the reward was the losing player's car. Getaway requires the player to outrun numerous pursuing police vehicles for a given time period. Time Trap is where the racer has to finish a certain amount of laps within the time limit, with police cars trying to slow them down. Career mode incorporates a monetary reward system that allows a player to purchase vehicles and performance upgrades while earning cash by racing in a chronological set of tournaments. Another innovation is the introduction of damage models. Vehicles which have been involved in accidents featured visibly crushed car bodies and suffered from performance penalties. After a race in Career mode, the player is given the option to purchase repairs. The mode also allows players, for the first time, to upgrade cars, although the feature simply consists of switching between three upgrade levels for each car.</p>

<p>The second era heavily diverted from the original roots. Exotic cars with scenic locations were cut-off from the later games, split-screen was also cut off, and none of the games featured in-car cockpit. The second era is based on the illegal street racing scene in the United States, popularized by the The Fast and the Furious movie franchise. Exotic European sports cars were cut-off from the games, but were reintroduced in Most Wanted. They included Japanese import and popular "tuner" cars. The games featured car customization, first included in High Stakes, but featured performance upgrades (from High Stakes) and also a new feature, visual customization, which formed the basis on the rest of the games in this era. The second era also featured in-game storylines, CGI movies, and open-world sandbox maps rather than closed tracks. This is also the start with Ferrari no longer taking part in the series. Ferrari never came back for the whole of the second and the majority of the third generation.</p>
