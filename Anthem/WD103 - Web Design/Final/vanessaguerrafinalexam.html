		<p>In this coding class I feel I learned a lot of things. Noticing first of all that this subject was like learning and typing in an other leanguage, I know basicaly is a leanguage for the network and computer world. I learned how to build the platform and skeleton of a website, the order of the basic tags that are the ones that make the page: (!doctype), (html), (head), (body) and (footer) each open and clouse tag. The css file is something new that I learned, before I didnt understand the difference of html and css. Css brings live to the websites adding the style that you are looking for. In the css the styles can be: color, text, background, borders, content, margins, paddings, float, clear and others.

		I learned how to measure the containers and borders of the content and images that I want to display in the website. I noticed that there is a lot of ways to apply an specific step or objective that I want too. I think and feel that I am capable to creat a simple website, with the platform and styles</p>

		<p>I think that the topics that made the greatest impression was all the type of tags and words that we use in the class, also how to bring an image to the background of a website and simply all the things we had to type to bring live and color to a website. I think thats the objective of creating a website, to make it entertaining, fun, colorful and posible to practicaly interact with the users.</p>

		<p>The topics I found the most difficult to grasp were when we had to save the files carfuly in the correct folder to call them in the websites and show up. I think is a litter bit confusing and delicate. At the begining I felt very difficult how to call the tags from the html file to the css, but at the end I understand it.</p>

		<p>In my opinion I think the course is effective and beneficial, just that would be better and the students can catch up more the class if they all for sure have a computer at home to practice.</p>

		<p>I think this course helped me a lot with the coding, eventhough I am not coding lover, but I felt that I understud a lot of concepts that I didnt know at all.</p>
