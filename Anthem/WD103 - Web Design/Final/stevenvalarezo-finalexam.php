			<h2>Article</h2>
			
				<p>To be honest what ive learned this month to my knowledge was not enough! I admit, i was out due to family related issues and self-related issues but i still managed to squeeze in a few information on what i've learned. From tagging to styling and creating web site layouts that i have never done before ever in my life, it's really a great experiance. Learning on how to code is definitly something that someone will enjoy doing if they are up for a challenge! Within this month learning what i was being taught was ok to myself, as im not really a coder type of guy but it will come in handy one day. What we learned pretty much was basic html5 coding, how to build structure and how to keep everything organized suched as files, images, and the structure itself!. Styling the page/pages i can say is my favorite part of coding. Why styling? you ask! because it's awesome, you can really show what your made of when you are creating the site or the blog. it is pretty much how you want it to look, which is awesome to my sense. There is alot of creativity in this world and just knowing how to put "Hypertext Markup Language" together makes it even more creative. 
				</p>

			<h2>Topics</h2>
				<h3>Great Impression</h3>

				<p>The topic that gave me a great impression towards this month was styling. it was yet so easy and comfortable to do as well as fun to view on how the site was being implemented. 
				</p>

				<h3>Most Difficult</h3>

				<p>The most difficult topic i think was just placing the images and figuring out how to move them around the right way and placing them where you wanted them to be at. Easy? not really i was really getting stuck at it and it was like an ok thing with me until i got help yet i know how to place them but moving them around really irritates me alot. it's ok though practice makes perfect!
				</p>

				<h3>My Opinion</h3>

				<p>In my opinion what would of made the course a little more effective and beneficial was if we didn't lectured a lot and we just went hands on. i believe lecturing is ok and works well if everything to mind come's great but then again why lecture if either way in the real world hands on training is much more accurate to where it will lead us. I don't know that's just my opinion.
				</p>

				<h3>My opinion completing this course</h3>
		 		
		 		<p>I believe not, the main reason why is because there is much more to learn within html and the whole coding structure. yes it is fun and i believe it's an awesome experiance, but then again i believe there is so much more you can learn and build on to with coding and styling and just creating this one career in your life where you know because of the course being extended to learn more then just the basic's has gave you the ability to have great knowledge.
