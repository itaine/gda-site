			<p>In the HTML5 & CSS3 class I learned the inportance of structure and the front-end wed coding.
			We learned the difference in internal, external, and in-line elements and how they overide each other when to use each and how. In my opinion I feel this course was very beneficail and that i have a good understanding of front-end wed design.</p>
