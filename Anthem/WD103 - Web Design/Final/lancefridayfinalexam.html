			<p>Durning this course i've learned a variety of things concerning frontend HTML5 (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). In a nutshell i was taught how to execute semantic HTML to prepare a active website. </p>

			<h2>Greatest Impression</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>My greatest impression from this course was to now know what type of freedom you have in creating your own website. The possibilties are endless if you understand how to combine HTML and CSS properly to create a website. I enjoyed the fact that you can pretty much do what ever you want as far as styling and using your own creativity.</p>

			<h2>Most Difficult</h2>
			<p>In my opinion, the most difficult thing about this course was the semantic aspect of HTML.
			i found it difficult because there were so many rules to follow and remember. If you made one little error or spelling mistake the whole code would not work and it just made it harder to troubleshoot.</p>

			<h2>More Effective and Beneficial</h2>
			<p>This course in my opinion, would have been more effective if we had a little more time. i feel it was a little rushed. Another way i feel it would have been a little bit better is if the information given was given a little slower so i as a student can properly obtain the information.Other than that that this course was pretty good.</p>
