			<h2>Summary</h2>

				<h3>What I Learned</h3>
				<p>The things I've learned in html this passed month was to structure web pages and make them pritty as Mr.Cook says. Using css to style up the page or pages and creating roots so the web file can be found also to keep our root file clean so thing are findable and named properly.</p>

				<h3>Greatest Impression</h3>
				<p>What impresstion were made, well I know now that coding is not all black and white it's the structural foundation of all my favorite web sites for reading manga and watch anine, but not just that I can use this to display infomation or if coded properly I'm sure I would be able to build any type of page with the right type of inspiration and infomation.</p>

				<h3>Difficulties</h3>
				<p>The hardest part was trying to get the styling of the css to work with the html link but everytime I end up missing sonething important that is needed or it's ither I don't have the correct tages in place or I'm just completely lost.</p>

				<h3>My Opinions</h3>
				<p>Practice is the key to good or even graet work that how I feel and these coding class are ruthless there is no part that I will understand right away. So to me doing what I can to try to catch the jist of coding insted of memorizing it like Mr.Cook says but in my mind I really don't find it painful just trying to memorize some of the code.</p>
