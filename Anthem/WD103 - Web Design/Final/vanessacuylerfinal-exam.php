			<h1> Frontend Development Basics - Final Exam</h1>
			<hr>

			<p>I learned how to properly utilize HTML5 and CSS. HTML stands for Hpyer Markup language and CSS stands for cascading styles sheets. I have also gained the knowledge of how to combine the styles of code to create a webpage. As well for the meaning of why code is so perative and understanding it rather than memerizing. As well as the difference between the two. Casacading Styling Sheets are used for making the websign dersirable something easy to look at. HTML is used to write the web content.</p>
